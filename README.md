Hello!!!, My name is Ricardo Escamilla student to Systems engineering, ammm i love Alternative Rock, Terror Files, and videogames haha

I have basic knowledge of Java and C#. I used Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio... I work on a Mac and I'm angry that they're removing Visual Studio support. My english is bad but but the best way to learn is with mistakes :)

My dream is create a enterprise of videogames indie
